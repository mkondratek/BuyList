# BuyList
BuyList is a website for listing things that you want to buy.

It is deployed on linux with PhpStorm and xampp (due to PhpStrom built-in web server problems).
I modeled on the site presented <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/create-a-christmas-wish-list-with-php/">here</a>.
My version changes the idea and has login and registration system improved (created in fact).
